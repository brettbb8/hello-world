Start learning C++/JUCE by creating audio plugins
Hi I'm Brett. I've been working with PureData visual audio programming language for about 14 years and I'm now keen to dig deeper into programming and learn C++ and JUCE and convert what I've created in PureData into an audio plugin, hopefully making it more efficient using this lower level language.
